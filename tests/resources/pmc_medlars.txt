TI  - Role of gender in the treatment experiences of people with an eating disorder: a 
      metasynthesis.
LID - 18
AB  - Background: Traditionally perceived as a disorder of women, Eating Disorders
      (EDs) are known to have impacts on people irrespective of their gender. This
      study is designed to synthesise the available qualitative research studies to
      more broadly understand the diverse experiences of ED and their treatment,
      specifically in relationship to issues of gender. Methods: The methodology
      involved a systematic search and quality appraisal of the literature published
      after 1980 using terms that aimed to represent the primary concepts of “role of
      gender” and “treatment experiences” and “eating disorders”. Nine qualitative
      studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-themes were inductively generated
      through a synthesis of data across themes from the relevant included papers.
      Results: Analysis of data was constructed around three meta-themes, each with
      subthemes. The first meta-theme “Out of sight, out of mind” depicted the
      experience of gender issues that were marginalised in treatment. More
      specifically for transgender people, when gender issues were ignored by treatment
      providers, this frequently led to non-disclosure of their gender identity.
      Furthermore, men were less likely to be assessed for an eating disorder and
      within this context; diagnosis of an ED and referral to specialist treatment was 
      frequently hindered. The second meta-theme “Lack of literacy among health care
      providers” focused on issues related to misdiagnosis of EDs, and the question of 
      whether this was related to a lack of health literacy amongst health
      professionals. The final theme “Pathways into treatment that address stigma and
      other barriers” highlighted the need for the development of future treatment
      interventions address the complex social reality of the experiencing person,
      including questions of gender. Conclusion: Gender issues impact upon the ED
      experience and require broader consideration in the development and evaluation of
      ED treatment interventions, including the further development of gender-informed 
      interventions. Trial registration: Protocol registered on PROSPERO 2017

TI  - Phonological coding during reading.
PG  - 1534-55
AB  - The exact role that phonological coding (the recoding of written, orthographic
      information into a sound based code) plays during silent reading has been
      extensively studied for more than a century. Despite the large body of research
      surrounding the topic, varying theories as to the time course and function of
      this recoding still exist. The present review synthesizes this body of research, 
      addressing the topics of time course and function in tandem. The varying theories
      surrounding the function of phonological coding (e.g., that phonological codes
      aid lexical access, that phonological codes aid comprehension and bolster
      short-term memory, or that phonological codes are largely epiphenomenal in
      skilled readers) are first outlined, and the time courses that each maps onto
      (e.g., that phonological codes come online early (pre-lexical) or that
      phonological codes come online late (post-lexical)) are discussed. Next the
      research relevant to each of these proposed functions is reviewed, discussing the
      varying methodologies that have been used to investigate phonological coding
      (e.g., response time methods, reading while eyetracking or recording EEG and MEG,
      concurrent articulation) and highlighting the advantages and limitations of each 
      with respect to the study of phonological coding. In response to the view that
      phonological coding is largely epiphenomenal in skilled readers, research on the 
      use of phonological codes in prelingually, profoundly deaf readers is reviewed.
      Finally, implications for current models of word identification
      (activation-verification model (Van Order, 1987), dual-route model (e.g.,
      Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001), parallel distributed
      processing model (Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989)) are discussed.

TI  - Becoming the Denigrated Other: Group Relations Perspectives on Initial Reactions 
      to a Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis.
LID - 347
AB  - The initial reactions to a bipolar disorder diagnosis of research participants in
      a small, qualitative study consisted of astonishment, dread of being “mad,” and
      extremely negative associations. All had prior mental health diagnoses, including
      episodes of severe depression (all but one) and alcoholism (one). All
      participants reported mental health histories prediagnosis and most had spent
      years contending with mental health labels, medications, symptoms, and
      hospitalizations. In addition, most participants were highly educated health
      professionals, quite familiar with the behaviors that the medical system
      considered to comprise bipolar disorder. Their negative associations to the
      initial bipolar disorder diagnosis, therefore, appeared inconsistent with their
      mental health histories and professional knowledge. This article contextualizes
      these initial reactions of shock and distress and proposes interpretations of
      these findings from societal and psychodynamic group relations perspectives. The 
      participants’ initial negative reactions are conceptualized as involving the
      terror of being transported from the group of “normal” people into the group of
      “mad” or “crazy” people, i.e., people with mental illnesses, who may constitute a
      societal “denigrated other.”
